//! Optional OTLP export layer (issue #56, ADR-0009 decisions 1 and 3).
//!
//! Compiled **only** when the `otlp` Cargo feature is enabled — off by
//! default. With the feature off, none of this module's four dependencies
//! (`opentelemetry`, `opentelemetry_sdk`, `opentelemetry-otlp`,
//! `tracing-opentelemetry`) are even compiled in, let alone linked; see
//! `Cargo.toml`'s `[features]` section, and this crate's `cargo build
//! -p trellis` (no flags) vs. `cargo build -p trellis --features otlp`,
//! both of which succeed independently.
//!
//! **This module never installs a global subscriber.** [`layer`] hands back
//! a plain `tracing_subscriber::Layer` for the *embedder* to compose into
//! their own subscriber (`tracing_subscriber::registry().with(...)`,
//! optionally alongside `tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()` for local
//! structured logs) and call `tracing::subscriber::set_global_default` on
//! themselves — matching `src/metrics.rs`'s "library, not a binary"
//! discipline for the `metrics` facade (that module never binds a socket;
//! this one never claims the process's one global subscriber slot). Every
//! span/event this crate emits (see `docs/observability.md`'s "Logs and
//! traces" section and `docs/decisions/0009-observability-decisions.md`
//! decision 3) flows through the ordinary `tracing` facade regardless of
//! whether this module — or the `otlp` feature at all — is ever used: with
//! no subscriber installed, or a subscriber built with no OTLP layer,
//! spans/events cost only the `tracing` crate's own near-zero
//! no-subscriber overhead ("local structured logs unaffected without a
//! collector" — issue #56's acceptance criteria).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "otlp")]
//! # fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use tracing_subscriber::layer::SubscriberExt;
//!
//! let provider = trellis::otel::tracer_provider("http://localhost:4317", "trellis")?;
//! let otlp_layer = trellis::otel::layer(&provider);
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(tracing_subscriber::registry().with(otlp_layer))?;
//!
//! // ... run the embedder's application ...
//!
//! // On shutdown: flush any spans still buffered in the batch exporter.
//! provider.shutdown()?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! [`tracer_provider`] and [`layer`] are deliberately two separate
//! functions, not one that installs everything: the embedder needs to keep
//! the [`opentelemetry_sdk::trace::SdkTracerProvider`] handle around to call
//! `.shutdown()` on process exit (flushing the batch exporter's buffer) —
//! something a single all-in-one `install()` function couldn't hand back
//! without inventing its own shutdown-guard type.
