//! The segment lifecycle's legal-transition graph (issue #9, stage 03) —
//! see the `stateDiagram-v2` in
//! docs/staging-and-claiming/03-sealing-and-the-fence.md.
//!
//! [`SegmentState::can_transition_to`] is the *one* function that owns this
//! graph. Stage 03 only ever drives `Active -> Sealed`; `Draining`/`Drained`
//! are here so the graph is complete from the start and a later stage
//! (claiming, apply) extends this function instead of re-deriving the edges
//! at a new call site.

/// One `segments.state` value. `Draining`/`Drained` aren't produced by this
/// stage — the registry's `state` CHECK constraint only allows `Active`/
/// `Sealed` so far — but they're modeled here so the transition graph below
/// is the complete one from the design doc, not a partial one this stage
/// happens to need.
