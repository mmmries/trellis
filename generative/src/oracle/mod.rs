//! The independent recompute oracle (design doc §2): renders a
//! [`engine::defs::ast::TransformDef`]'s formulas back to a `SELECT` against
//! the source and treats Postgres itself as the correctness authority. Uses
//! only the shared components design doc §2 names — the parser AST, a small
//! AST→`SELECT` printer written here (sharing no code with the engine's
//! evaluator), and [`engine::defs::oracle::recompute`] (evaluation, a
//! *secondary* parity check, not the pipeline-driving maintenance code that
//! is [`crate::backend`]'s job alone).
//!
//! # The three-way comparison
//!
//! Per op we compare three renderings of the same logical target:
//!
//! - **persisted target** — what [`crate::backend::Backend::snapshot`] read
//!   back from the maintained target table;
//! - **evaluator** — [`engine::defs::oracle::recompute`], the engine's own
//!   evaluator run from scratch;
//! - **SQL oracle** — the definition rendered back to a `SELECT` and run by
//!   Postgres itself.
//!
//! The SQL oracle is the authority (ADR-0004: the grammar is an immutable
//! subset of Postgres, so a rendered `SELECT` can never be outgrown by the
//! language). Comparing the other two *against it* localizes a divergence:
//! `target ≠ SQL` is a pipeline / apply / fold / ordering bug;
//! `evaluator ≠ SQL` is an eval-layer drift bug — the direct test of the
//! "engine mirrors Postgres" claim.
//!
//! # DB access
//!
//! Both oracles take an [`engine::Pool`] — a connection handle — exactly as
//! [`engine::defs::oracle::recompute`] already does. The oracle *reads*; it
//! never imports `engine::client`/`engine::staging` or otherwise drives the
//! maintenance pipeline (that seam is [`crate::backend`]'s alone). A
//! pool connection has its `search_path` pinned, so an unqualified source
//! table name resolves the same way `recompute` relies on.
