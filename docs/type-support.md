# Data-type support matrix

Which PostgreSQL data types Trellis supports, in **which role**. A living
reference, updated as each type/role lands. Driven by
[Epic #123](https://github.com/salesforce-misc/trellis/issues/123); the
candidacy constraint is
[ADR-0004](decisions/0004-transform-definition-grammar.md).

A type is never simply "supported." It earns its way into six roles, ordered
**floor → ceiling** — the matrix doubles as a maturity ladder, and most types
climb it left-to-right:

1. **Ingest / passthrough** — decode from logical replication and copy into a
   derived table unchanged. The floor under every other role, and nearly
   everything clears it. Since #108 a column's role is decided by its raw
   `pg_attribute.atttypid`, through the OID registry in
   `trellis/src/defs/pg_type.rs`, rather than by text-matching
   `format_type`'s rendering: every family the registry knows becomes a
   `ValueType::Other(PgType)` that keeps its concrete PG type end-to-end
   (`ddl::pg_type_name`), instead of the old `_ => Text` lie. An OID the
   registry *can't* place — an enum (dynamically assigned OID), an array,
   range, composite, domain or extension type — is `PgType::Unrecognized`
   and stays out of the validator's view entirely (`Trellis::source_columns`),
   so referencing it is a clean unresolved-column error; promoting those
   families is #117/#122's job.

   Since #111 the *exact integer* types are no longer part of that
   passthrough story at all: `smallint`/`integer`/`bigint` have their own
   `ValueType::Integer(IntWidth)` (see `trellis/src/integer.rs`), so a
   derived integer column is declared `integer` rather than `numeric`, and
   `numeric`/`real`/`double precision` keep `ValueType::Numeric` to
   themselves until #112 splits the floats out.
2. **Filter (predicate)** — appear in a `WHERE` predicate. Needs immutable
   comparison operators and the predicate grammar (stubbed to `TRUE` today,
   `ast.rs:185`).
3. **Join / relationship / `GROUP BY` key** — be matched by equality. Today via
   raw `::text` rendering (`TEXT_STABLE_JOIN_KEY_TYPES`,
   `trellis/src/defs/catalog.rs`; `to_rows_by_key`, `eval.rs`). Relationship
   join keys and 1-1 primary keys gate on that allowlist by pg type name; a
   `GROUP BY` key gates on its `ValueType` instead
   (`validate::UnsupportedGroupByKeyType`), rejecting every
   `ValueType::Other` family **except `oid`** — `::text` matching disagrees
   with those types' own `=` (`'1 day'::interval = '24 hours'`,
   `timestamptz`/`bytea` under session GUCs), and `json` has no `=` at all,
   whereas `oid_out` is canonical unsigned decimal (#111).
4. **Primary key** — identify a target row. A stricter join key: it must come
   from the source's replica identity and present in the old-image for
   updates/deletes. Gated to the join-key-safe allowlist
   (`is_text_stable_join_key_type`) — an unsafe single-column PK
   (`numeric`/`timestamptz`/`bytea`, which `::text`-matching would silently
   mismatch) is rejected at define time with `DdlError::UnsupportedPrimaryKeyType`
   (#107). The typed key index (below) later unlocks those types as safe keys.
5. **Computed 1-1 target** — a scalar calculated field *produces* this type
   (distinct from passthrough). Needs an immutable evaluator arm **and** grammar
   to spell a literal/cast of the type.
6. **Aggregate target** — an aggregate calculated field folds to this type.
   Gated by fold economics: `SUM`/`COUNT`/`AVG` invertible (cheap deltas);
   `MIN`/`MAX` orderable-but-not-invertible; `array_agg`/`string_agg`/`jsonb_agg`
   order-sensitive.

## Legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | works today |
| 🎯 | in scope for the epic |
| ⚠️ | conditional / needs design decision |
| ❌ | excluded (immutability or no equality) |
| — | not applicable |

`COUNT(*)` is type-agnostic row-counting (`registry.rs:160`, #75) — not a
per-type capability, so it's omitted from the aggregate cells.

| `bytea` | ✅ (hex text) | 🎯 | 🎯 typed index | 🎯 typed index | ✅ literal (#109) | ⚠️ MIN/MAX | `bytea_output` GUC affects text render; literal must be canonical lowercase hex |
| `date` | ✅ | 🎯 | 🎯 typed index | 🎯 typed index | ✅ literal (#109) | 🎯 MIN/MAX | `DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'` only; `'today'` is why `date_in` is STABLE |
| `timestamp` `timestamptz` | ✅ | 🎯 | 🎯 typed index | 🎯 typed index | ✅ literal (#109), `timestamptz` 🎯 | 🎯 MIN/MAX | tz text render is TZ-dependent, so only plain `timestamp` can be spelled |

| `jsonb` | ✅ | 🎯 | ⚠️ typed index | ⚠️ | 🎯 needs a canonicalizer | ⚠️ `jsonb_agg` STABLE in PG | `json` excluded (no `=`); `jsonb_out` re-sorts keys, so a literal needs #115's value model |

## The immutability gate

ADR-0004 admits only operators/functions whose output depends solely on their
inputs. `pg_proc.provolatile` is the ground truth — several intuitions are wrong:

* **`money`** — comparison (`cash_eq`/`cash_cmp`) *is* immutable, but text I/O
  (`cash_out`) is `STABLE` (`lc_monetary`), so the CDC-decoded text is
  locale-dependent. Excluded; use `numeric`.
* **`json`** — has *no* `=` operator; can never be a key. `jsonb` can.
* **`text`/`varchar`/`char`** — Postgres marks these comparisons IMMUTABLE
  despite collation-sensitivity. Our own bar is a **deterministic collation** (or
  a normalized stored form); `char(n)`'s hazard is blank-padding, not volatility.
* **`timestamptz`/`bytea`** — value comparison immutable, but *text rendering*
  is GUC-dependent (`TimeZone`, `bytea_output`). This is why a **typed key
  index** — comparing decoded values, not text — is the real unlock.
* **`jsonb_agg`** — marked `STABLE` in Postgres; whether Trellis's own
  deterministic reimplementation may treat it as immutable is an open question.
* **`xml`/`tsvector`/`tsquery`** — no useful immutable equality/ordering; niche.

## Cross-cutting concerns

* **Casts / coercion lattice** — computing a new type needs literal and `CAST`
  grammar. **Landed for literals (#109):** `DATE '2024-01-01'` and the
  equivalent `CAST('2024-01-01' AS date)` both produce a real typed constant,
  over an allowlist (`date`, `timestamp`, `bytea`, and `oid` since #111)
  whose literal text must be
  in Postgres's canonical output spelling — see
  [ADR-0004](decisions/0004-transform-definition-grammar.md#typed-literals-issue-109).
  Still open: a **general** coercion lattice (`CAST(<expr> AS <type>)` over a
  non-literal), which each type family's own child decides, since most pairs
  are not immutable.
* **Typed key index** — replacing the raw-`::text` match unlocks
  `timestamp`/`bytea`/`date`/`numeric`/… as safe keys; the single
  highest-leverage child for the key roles. Note what it is *not* needed
  for: the exact integer types and `oid` render canonically (`-`, then
  digits — no `+`, no leading zeros, no padding, no session GUC), so
  `a::text = b::text` already agrees with their native `=` for every value,
  which is why they are on `TEXT_STABLE_JOIN_KEY_TYPES` rather than waiting
  for the index. #111's contribution to the key roles was therefore *type
  honesty*, not a new encoding: integer keys used to work by sharing
  `numeric`'s decimal rendering, which is also why the `GROUP BY` key gate
  still lets a genuinely unsafe `numeric` key through (see the
  `numeric`/`decimal` row) — tightening that is #110/#112's call, not #111's.
* **Exact integer semantics (#111)** — `+` and the aggregates follow
  Postgres's own operator family, including its overflow behaviour: `int4 +
  int4` is `integer` and raises `22003 numeric_value_out_of_range` past the
  range, `int4 + numeric` promotes to unbounded `numeric` and cannot;
  `sum(int2|int4) -> bigint`, `sum(int8) -> numeric`, `avg(<int>) ->
  numeric`, `min`/`max` keep their argument's width. `COUNT(*)` is
  unchanged (`numeric`); Postgres types it `bigint`, which is #120's to
  align since it has nothing to do with the integer split. Cross-checked
  against a live server in `trellis/tests/defs_exact_integers.rs` via
  `pg_typeof`, never against Trellis's own renderer (ADR-0013).
* **Aggregate maintenance** — order-sensitive aggregates (`array_agg`,
  `string_agg`, `jsonb_agg`) need an incremental-delta design or a
  group-recompute fallback, and an `ORDER BY`-inside-aggregate grammar decision.
